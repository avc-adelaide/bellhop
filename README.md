# BELLHOP

* Bellhop is an underwater acoustics simulator, part of the [Acoustics Toolbox](http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/AcousticsToolbox/)

* The Bellhop component of the Acoustics Toolbox has been extracted UCal San Diego to support the [multithreaded C++/CUDA version: `bellhopcuda`](https://github.com/A-New-BellHope/bellhopcuda). The UCal team also [maintain a fork of the Fortran sources](https://github.com/A-New-BellHope/bellhop) with numerical properties and robustness improved and bugs fixed; some of these changes have been back-ported into the Acoustics Toolbox directly but the codebases are no longer identical

* This repository is a subsequent fork from Adelaide University, Australia, with the intention of providing a clean and well-documented repository to provide easier access to the code. The main features of the AU work are:
    * Consolidation of code files and build processes with a single set of clean sources
    * Source code documentation using FORD, using consistent formatting of code comments
    * Addition of explicit regression and unit test files
    * Continuous integration through Github for test suite and code coverage

## Installation

### Mac

Use Homebrew to install `gfortran`:

    brew install gfortran

The Makefile should automatically set up the correct compiler flags, in which case run:

    make
    make install

This will install binaries `bellhop(3d).exe` into the `./bin` directory, which should be
added via your standard shell configuration. The Makefile message outputs an example of how
to do this for a `.zshrc` setup.

For using `arlpy` (Python), additional packages are needed. These sometimes require a fixed version of Python,
which at time of writing required something like: (you may not wish to use `venv`, for instance)

    brew install python@3.12
    brew install pipx
    brew install hatch

    $(brew --prefix python@3.12)/bin/python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/bellhop
    source ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/activate
    ln -fs `pwd`/bin/bellhop.exe ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/bellhop.exe

    pip3 install matplotlib
    pip3 install arlpy
    pip3 install pytest

These steps are needed for manually running the test suite, etc. You might be able to get
away with `hatch` taking care of most of these things for you.

### Linux

> [!NOTE]
> This section is work in progress and drafted by copilot.

Install the required dependencies on Ubuntu (for other distributions like RHEL/CentOS/Fedora or Arch Linux, use the appropriate package manager):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gfortran liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev python3.12 python3.12-pip python3.12-venv graphviz

# If python3.12 is not available, python3 (>= 3.10) may work but python3.12 is recommended
# sudo apt install gfortran liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev python3 python3-pip python3-venv graphviz
```

Build and install the Fortran executables:
```bash
make
make install
```

This will install `bellhop.exe` and `bellhop3d.exe` in the `./bin` directory. Add this directory to your PATH:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For Python environment setup (recommended using virtual environment):
```bash
# Use python3.12 if installed, otherwise python3
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/bellhop
# OR: python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/bellhop

source ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install hatch matplotlib arlpy pytest

# Link bellhop executables to the virtual environment (optional)
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/bellhop.exe" ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/bellhop.exe
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/bellhop3d.exe" ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/bellhop3d.exe
```

**Note:** Remember to activate the virtual environment in future sessions:
```bash
source ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/activate
```

### Windows

> [!NOTE]
> This section is work in progress and drafted by copilot.

Install MSYS2 following the instructions at [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/).

After installation, open the MSYS2 terminal and install the required development tools:

```bash
# Update the package database
pacman -Syu

# Install development tools and dependencies
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip
```

Add the MinGW64 tools to your PATH by adding this line to your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export PATH="/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
```

Build and install the Fortran executables:
```bash
make
make install
```

This will install `bellhop.exe` and `bellhop3d.exe` in the `./bin` directory. Add this directory to your PATH:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For Python environment setup (recommended using virtual environment):
```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/bellhop
source ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install hatch matplotlib arlpy pytest

# Link bellhop executables to the virtual environment (optional)
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/bellhop.exe" ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/bellhop.exe
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/bellhop3d.exe" ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/bellhop3d.exe
```

**Note:** Remember to activate the virtual environment in future MSYS2 sessions:
```bash
source ~/.venvs/bellhop/bin/activate
```

### Matlab

If you wish to use the Matlab interfaces, the following commands should be added to your
`startup.m` file to add `bellhop` to the Matlab path:

    addpath(genpath('<path to bellhop>/Matlab/'))
    addpath('<path to bellhop>/bin/')







## Testing

If the build and installation steps were successful, you should now be able to run
the Python test suite:

    hatch run test


## üèóÔ∏è Building Documentation Locally

Generate documentation on your machine:
```bash
sudo apt install graphviz  # Required for call graphs and flow diagrams

# Generate documentation with graphs
hatch run doc
open doc/index.html  # View generated documentation
```


## Code Coverage Analysis

BELLHOP includes integrated support for code coverage analysis using GCOV.
This helps assess how much of the codebase is exercised by tests and identify areas that may need additional testing.
Further information can be found in [Coverage Docs](docs/coverage.md).


## Other information

See index.htm for information from the original repo.

Code initially retrieved 12/17/21 from http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/AcousticsToolbox/ ,
the version labeled 11/4/20. In late 2022, the diff between mbp's newer 4/20/22
and 11/4/20 releases was computed, and the changes were applied to this code
(with appropriate changes to integrate them).

Files pertaining to the other simulators (Krakel, Kraken, KrakenField, Scooter)
have been removed.
