## Overview

BELLHOP is a beam/ray tracing model by Michael B. Porter (Heat, Light, and Sound Research, Inc.) for predicting acoustic pressure fields in ocean environments. The model accounts for:

- Sound speed profiles (SSPs) varying with depth and range
- Ocean boundaries (surface and seafloor) with complex reflection properties
- Acoustic sources and receiver arrays in arbitrary geometries
- Both 2D (range-depth) and 3D (range-depth-azimuth) propagation modeling

The core algorithms implement:
- Geometric ray tracing
- Gaussian beam superposition for smooth field predictions
- Arrival time and amplitude calculations
- Coherent and incoherent field summation


## Usage

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for build instructions.

### Fortran

Basic usage:
```
bellhop.exe inputfile
bellhop3d.exe inputfile
```

Input files have an `.env` extension and specify:
- Ocean environment (sound speed, boundaries, bathymetry)
- Source characteristics (frequency, depth, beam pattern)
- Receiver array geometry
- Run parameters (ray angles, output options)

Additional text files can be provided to define tables of sound speed profile (.ssp), bathometry (.bty), and so on.

### Python

A modern [Python interface](media/python/index.html) is provided in this package. Basic usage:
```
    TODO
```
This allows reading and writing of bellhop-native input and output files, with a modern Python interface for specifying parameters and executing calculation tasks.

The automated test suite for this repository is written using this Python `bellhop` module.

This Python interface is extended from the [`arlpy` module `uwapm`](https://arlpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uwapm.html) by Mandar Chitre.

## Repository architecture

As a historic codebase, Bellhop is impressively portable and easy to compile.
This repository serves as a largely untouched extraction of Bellhop from the broader Acoustics Toolbox code.

### Repository contributions

The following are the major changes or additions:

* Remove non-Bellhop files entirely. If other components of the AT should be similarly modernised, in my view independent repositories should be used. The shared code is relatively small.

* Improve Makefile to attempt to auto-configure compiler flags. This is mostly a stub as I have limited platforms and compilers to experiment with.

* Alter the commenting style of the code to permit automatic documentation using FORD. This tool creates the current documentation you are reading.

* Add a Python test suite. This has multiple purposes:

    * Provide a fully documented and automated regression test suite that checks numerical outputs. The original Bellhop tests required manual checking that the output was valid.

    * Integrate the tests with a code coverage tool that allows us to ensure that all possible code paths are tested (work in progress).

    * Allow GitHub workflows to automatically test the repository for every code change. This allows refactoring and algorithm improvements without added risk of introducing bugs.

### Technical details

* The base code compilation processes are based on Makefiles. These have been extended to support the code coverage tool. The [key Makefile](https://github.com/AUMAG/bellhop/blob/main/Makefile) is at the root of the repository.

* A modern build system using Hatch is also used for building documentation and running tests. These are configured using [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/AUMAG/bellhop/blob/main/pyproject.toml). This build system makes the GitHub CI processes quite straightforward to define.

* The documentation system uses FORD, configured using [fdm.toml](https://github.com/AUMAG/bellhop/blob/main/fpm.toml). Executing the documentation process is managed by Hatch with

    hatch run doc

* The test suite uses `pytest` with a build process set up using Hatch. Run the test suite using

    make && make install # if necessary
    hatch run test

* The code coverage system uses the GCC tool `gcov`. This is controlled via the Makefile, with results compiled into HTML files using an ad hoc Python script. Improvements to this process to use more standardised COTS tools would be good. (ChatGPT/Copilot helped me a fair degree with this.) Hatch doesnâ€™t yet run the code coverage tool; WIL to streamline.

* There are two GitHub CI workflows: regression testing, and documentation build (which includes code coverage). They are set up using [check.yml](https://github.com/AUMAG/bellhop/blob/main/.github/workflows/check.yml) and [docs.yml](https://github.com/AUMAG/bellhop/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml).
